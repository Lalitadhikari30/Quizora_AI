This is a sample document for testing text extraction functionality.

It contains multiple sentences and paragraphs to verify that the ContentExtractionService is working properly.

The purpose is to extract this text and verify that:
1. Text extraction is successful
2. Extracted text is not empty
3. Extracted text length is correct
4. Text content is preserved accurately

This should demonstrate that the new architecture with persistent ExtractedContent storage is working correctly.

End of test document.
